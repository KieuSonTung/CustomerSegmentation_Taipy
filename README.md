# *Customer Segementation using Taipy*

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation project repository! This project aims to provide insights into customer behavior and preferences through segmentation analysis. Using the Taipy open-source package for visualization, this project offers an intuitive exploration of customer segments derived from the data. Below is an overview of the project components and how to navigate through the repository.

### Overview

Understanding customer segments is crucial for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize profitability. This project employs advanced segmentation techniques to partition customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing habits, demographics, and other relevant factors.

### Data Analysis and Preprocessing

The project begins with thorough data analysis and preprocessing steps to ensure the quality and suitability of the data for segmentation analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between various customer attributes. Additionally, preprocessing techniques such as normalization and feature scaling are performed to prepare the data for segmentation.

### Segmentation Analysis

The core of the project revolves around segmentation analysis using clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or Gaussian mixture models. These algorithms automatically group customers with similar characteristics together, enabling businesses to identify distinct market segments and tailor their strategies accordingly.
